The VLSI design flow is a systematic process with key stages: specification, design entry, synthesis, physical design, and verification. Physical design, also called the back-end, converts the logic netlist into a manufacturable chip layout through steps like floorplanning, placement, and routing, while considering power, performance, and timing constraints. 

Overall VLSI Design Flow
Specification: Define the requirements and functionality of the chip.
Design Entry: Describe the design using a hardware description language like Verilog or SystemVerilog.
Verification: Use simulation and other techniques to ensure the logic design is correct.
Synthesis: Convert the high-level HDL description into a gate-level netlist of standard cells.
Physical Design: Transform the netlist into a physical layout (see below).
Fabrication: Produce the physical chips based on the final layout.
Testing: Verify the functionality and quality of the manufactured chips. 



Physical Design Methodologies
This phase transforms the logical netlist into a physical layout for fabrication. 
Inputs: A gate-level netlist, design constraints (like SDC files), and technology libraries (LIB, LEF).
Floorplanning: Determine the chip's overall size and core area. Place major blocks (macros) and reserves areas for power and ground.
Placement: Position standard cells within the allocated space while optimizing for timing and area.
Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS): Design a clock network that minimizes skew across the chip.
Routing: Connect the cells with wires on different metal layers based on the netlist.
Physical Verification: Perform Design Rule Checks (DRC) to ensure the layout meets the strict geometric requirements for manufacturing and check for Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) errors to ensure the layout matches the netlist.
Output: A final layout database (like a GDSII file) that is used for mask creation.
